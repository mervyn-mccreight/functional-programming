# README

This repository contains the solutions to tasks me and my classmate [Tim Pauls](https://www.github.com/timpauls) did as part of the [functional
programming course (german)](http://intern.fh-wedel.de/~si/vorlesungen/fp/fp.html) (held by [Prof. Dr. Uwe Schmidt](https://github.com/UweSchmidt)) of the [FH Wedel](https://www.fh-wedel.de).
